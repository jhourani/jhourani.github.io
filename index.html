<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>I am finishing a CS degree from the <a href="http://www.umb.edu/">University of Massachusetts, Boston</a> in the Fall of 2013, and currently working as a software engineer/intern at a bio-tech company in Cambridge, MA called <strong><a href="http://selventa.com/">Selventa</a></strong>. I have worked at <strong><a href="http://selventa.com/">Selventa</a></strong> since the summer of 2012, and truly enjoy all of the things I have had the opportunity to experience here thus far. I have not only become more proficient in the languages I knew already, but have been able to add several more technologies to my tool belt as well. In addition to being a motivated and upbeat programmer, I am also a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. These experiences played a large role in becoming the person I am today, and the skills I learned while in the military certainly work to compliment those that I have developed during my academic career.</p>

<h3>
<a name="projects" class="anchor" href="#projects"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Projects</h3>

<p><em><strong>Work</strong></em> - I have taken up several projects throughout the course of my internship. Most of my work is open source, and can be viewed from my <strong><a href="https://github.com/jhourani">Github</a></strong> repository.</p>

<ul>
<li>Designed and constructed the homepage for the <strong><a href="http://wiki.openbel.org/display/home/Home">OpenBel wiki</a></strong>, which acts as a gateway for new customers learning about the <strong>OpenBel</strong> language and the underlying framework. Also, migrated all of our existing data surrounding the <strong>OpenBel</strong> platform from standard Microsoft Word documents to our current <strong><a href="http://wiki.openbel.org/display/home/Home">OpenBel wiki</a></strong> page.</li>
<li>Researched, implemented, and did some standard benchmarking on NO-SQL database solutions, particularly graph-based databases like <a href="http://www.neo4j.org/">Neo4J</a> and <a href="http://www.orientdb.org/">OrientDB</a>. This allowed me to become more familiar with different types of databases, outside of the MYSQL world, and also to research and implement some of the latest technology in the database world.</li>
<li>Contributed bug fixes and code enhancements to the current <strong><a href="https://github.com/OpenBEL">OpenBel Framework</a></strong>
</li>
<li>Currently writing a Python package to automate the building and updating of the <strong><a href="http://resource.belframework.org/belframework/1.0/">BEL Namespace</a></strong>, which including parsing, storing, and finding equivalences among the various datasets.</li>
</ul><p><em><strong>School</strong></em> - I have had the opportunity to work on several projects throughout my academic career as well. </p>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Embedded systems programming</strong>. Some of this involved accessing the computers Serial port through a device called the UART. We were able to push bits through the input, do some logic on them, and verify that we received the same data back in the output. This is where I was introduced to polling and event-driven interrupts.</li>
<li>
<strong>OS programming</strong>. I was able to add several features to a small operating system much like Unix/Linux. Some of the things involved in this project were memory mapping, splitting jobs up between various processes (and keeping track of those processes), and making explicit system calls through the use of both polling and event-driven interrupts.</li>
<li>
<strong>Java compiler</strong>. Actually, it was a subset of Java called <strong><a href="http://www.cs.umb.edu/j--/javadoc/jminusminus/package-summary.html">J--</a></strong>. I made modifications to the context-free grammar, and then implemented those changes in code. Not only did I learn a lot of the ins and outs of Java, but getting the hands-on opportunity to turn a context-free grammar into actual working code was a great learning experience.</li>
<li>Developed a <strong>Ruby-on-Rails</strong> application. Perhaps the "coolest" project that I participated in during college was a Ruby-on-Rails application called <strong><a href="http://cryptic-taiga-8999.herokuapp.com/users/sign_in">Approximation Calculator</a></strong>. This was such a fun project to work on! I got to learn Ruby-on-Rails pretty well, and was able to develop an actual working product for a real client (though it is not in use currently, as there were some complications with IT at the clients business). The idea of the application was to give elementary school children a tool to aid them in estimating arithmetic problems. The program is still quite functional, feel free to contact me for the default login information if you would like to poke around with it. Unfortunately, the source code is currently in a private repository and is not open source. However, we are working to move it to a public repository in the near future.</li>

<a name="languages-and-skills" class="anchor" href="#languages-and-skills"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Languages and Skills</h3>

<p>When I was a junior in college, I never thought I would say this. But, after using Python pretty regularly for some time, I have to say it is fast becoming my favorite language to code in. I am also a very proficient Java programmer, as that was the language I basically learned programming in. In my spare time, I have also done some work in <strong>Ruby</strong>, <strong>LISP</strong>, <strong>Haskell</strong>, <strong>Javascript</strong>, <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>XML</strong>...and there are probably a couple more that I am forgetting. Learning new languages and technologies is something I enjoy, and ideally anywhere I work for a long period of time should be a place that encourages and supports this kind of professional development.</p>

<p>I also am familiar with some <strong>MVC</strong> and <strong>CMS</strong> frameworks. Mainly <strong>Ruby-on-Rails</strong>, but I have also done a little in <strong>ExtJS</strong> and <strong>Drupal</strong>.</p>
