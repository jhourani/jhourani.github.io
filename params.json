{"name":"Jordan Hourani","tagline":"Welcome to my homepage!","body":"### About me\r\nI am finishing a CS degree from the [University of Massachusetts, Boston](http://www.umb.edu/) in the Fall of 2013, and currently working as a software engineer/intern at a bio-tech company in Cambridge, MA called **[Selventa](http://selventa.com/)**. I have worked at **[Selventa](http://selventa.com/)** since the summer of 2012, and truly enjoy all of the things I have had the opportunity to experience here thus far. I have not only become more proficient in the languages I knew already, but have been able to add several more technologies to my tool belt as well. In addition to being a motivated and upbeat programmer, I am also a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. These experiences played a large role in becoming the person I am today, and the skills I learned while in the military certainly work to compliment those that I have developed during my academic career.\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n_**Work**_ - I have taken up several projects throughout the course of my internship. Most of my work is open source, and can be viewed from my **[Github](https://github.com/jhourani)** repository.\r\n\r\n* Designed and constructed the homepage for the **[OpenBel wiki](http://wiki.openbel.org/display/home/Home)**, which acts as a gateway for new customers learning about the **OpenBel** language and the underlying framework. Also, migrated all of our existing data surrounding the **OpenBel** platform from standard Microsoft Word documents to our current **[OpenBel wiki](http://wiki.openbel.org/display/home/Home)** page.\r\n* Researched, implemented, and did some standard benchmarking on NO-SQL database solutions, particularly graph-based databases like [Neo4J](http://www.neo4j.org/) and [OrientDB](http://www.orientdb.org/). This allowed me to become more familiar with different types of databases, outside of the MYSQL world, and also to research and implement some of the latest technology in the database world.\r\n* Contributed bug fixes and code enhancements to the current **[OpenBel Framework](https://github.com/OpenBEL)**\r\n* Wrote a Python package to automate the building and updating of the **[BEL Namespace](http://resource.belframework.org/belframework/1.0/)**, which including parsing, storing, and finding equivalences among the various datasets.\r\n\r\n### Languages and Skills\r\n(Under construction)\r\n\r\n### Professional Areas of Interest\r\n(Under construction)\r\n\r\n### Personal Areas of Interest\r\n(Under construction)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
