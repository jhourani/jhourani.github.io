{"name":"Jordan Hourani","tagline":"Welcome to my homepage!","body":"### About me\r\nI am finishing a CS degree from the [University of Massachusetts, Boston](http://www.umb.edu/) in the Fall of 2013, and currently working as a software engineer/intern at **[Selventa](http://selventa.com/)**. I have worked at **[Selventa](http://selventa.com/)** since the summer of 2012, and truly enjoy all of the things I have gotten to experience here thus far. I have not only become more proficient in the languages I knew already, but have been able to add several more technologies to my tool belt as well. In addition to being a motivated and upbeat programmer, I am also a veteran of the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. These experiences played a large role in becoming the person I am today, and the skills I learned while in the military certainly work to compliment those that I have developed during my academic career.\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n(Under construction)\r\n\r\n### Languages and Skills\r\n(Under construction)\r\n\r\n### Professional Areas of Interest\r\n(Under construction)\r\n\r\n### Personal Areas of Interest\r\n(Under construction)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
