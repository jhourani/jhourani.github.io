{"name":"Jordan Hourani","tagline":"Welcome to my homepage!","body":"### About me\r\nI am finishing a CS degree from the [University of Massachusetts, Boston](http://www.umb.edu/) in the Fall of 2013, and currently working as a software engineer/intern at **[Selventa](http://selventa.com/)**. I have worked at **[Selventa](http://selventa.com/)** since the summer of 2012, and truly enjoy all of the things I have gotten to experience here thus far. I have not only become more proficient in the languages I knew already, but have been able to add several more technologies to my tool belt as well. I have worked primarily in **Java** and **Python**, but have done some things in **Ruby** also. And, of course, what programmer would be complete without sufficient skills in **C** and basic **Assembler**. I am absolutely looking forward to entering the workforce full-time soon, and hope that wherever I end up it is a place I can continue to grow and develop my skills as a software developer.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
